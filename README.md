# P5 Oo Inheritance 
 
##Learning Competencies 

##Summary 

 ## Overview 

In this challenge you will practice refactoring with inheritance.

You will take an existing program and refactor it, demonstrating your knowledge of object oriented design and inheritance. 

### Topics covered

To achieve this, you will use knoweledge of the following: 

* Understanding existing code
* Refactoring with inheritance
* Classes and inheritance
* Writing tests

### Resources

* http://www.ruby-doc.org
* [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.poodr.info/)

## Objective: Refactoring

Open the gist to see the original code with three very interesting classes of things you can drive. This code should look terrible to you by now and you should be itching to refactor it. 

**Part 1: Write tests** Write a FULL set of tests to test this code (at least 10 tests). Make sure all the tests pass BEFORE refactoring the code.

**Part 2: Refactoring with Inheritance**  Now factor out a base class called Vehicle that incorporates the shared behavior of the three sub classes.  Your final code will have a base class and the three subclasses. Make sure all your tests  still pass.

**Part 3: Get Creative** Add some additional functionality to the base class and at least one of the subclasses. Write tests for this functionality. 

**Optional: Extra Credit** Refactor using Composition instead of Inheritance. Verify that all your tests still pass. 

### You are done when...

Your driver code can test the modified program, and these tests always pass. 

### What to submit 

Submit a version of the code that saitisifies the requirements of parts 2 & 3 (include your tests from part 1). If you go for the extra credit, submit that code seperately.

## Reflection

Object oriented design is a powerful pattern you'll use going forward. It may feel over-designed for the programs you are writing now, so remember these are teaching exercises. You don't have to maintain them years into the future, or hand them off to an operations team in a different city. Real world projects always trend towards more complexity, which is where good design patterns become essential.
